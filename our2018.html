<h1>3 wonderful years</h1>


<div id='future'>
<p> This year 2018 has only just began, and we have already done so many different things. Our concert that we managed to survive at the Place Bell even though it was freezing cold.
  Our Salsa lessons that which we kept skipping but were still an enjoyable experience. And going bouldering together, for once we found
  an activity we both enjoy.  And our lovely experience at the cheesecake factory,that place was good,
  in any case I've been enjoying all our time together and I can't wait to spend so many other wonderful moments together.
  Je t'aime mon amour<br/>
